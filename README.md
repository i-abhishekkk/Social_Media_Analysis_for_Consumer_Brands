Social media analytics is the ability to gather and find meaning in data gathered from social channels to support business decisions â€” and measure the performance of actions based on those decisions through social media.

Consumer insights from social media allows them to capture what a brand's key customer uses, consumes, and purchases. Specifically, the spontaneity behind messages posted allows analysts to contextualize user generated content through the geolocation, products mentioned, visuals, comments, and hashtags present.
